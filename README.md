# Data and script repository for the article Araujo et al. 'Paragenesis and precipitation stages of Nb-Ta-oxide minerals in phosphorus-rich rare-element pegmatites (Buranga dike, Rwanda)'

The manuscript to which these data and scripts are related to is accepted for publication in the American Mineralogist. <br>
DOI: <https://doi.org/10.2138/am-2022-8201>

The article is currently in press (available in the [journal pre-print server](http://www.minsocam.org/MSA/Ammin/AM_Preprints.html)) and waiting for the issue assignment.  

## Folders are divided into: 
- **Data**: contains all the datasets divided by the analytical techniques
    - **Mineral_chemistry**: hosts the files with the chemical composition of minerals as measured by EPMA
    - **Raman_spectra**: hosts the peak and spectra data from minerals as measured by Raman spectroscopy
- **Scripts**: contains the scripts used for processing and plotting the data
