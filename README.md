# Data and script repository for the article Araujo et al. 'Paragenesis, saturation, and precipitation conditions of Nb-Ta-oxide minerals in phosphorus-rich rare-element pegmatites'

The manuscript to which these data and scripts are related to is currently under review for publication in the American Mineralogist. 

## Folders are divided into: 
- **Data**: contains all the raw datasets divided into the analytical techniques
    - **Mineral_chemistry**: hosts the files with the chemical composition of minerals as measured by EPMA
    - **Raman_spectra**: hosts the peak and spectra data from minerals as measured by Raman spectroscopy
- **Scripts**: contains the scripts used for processing the raw data and plotting the processed data
